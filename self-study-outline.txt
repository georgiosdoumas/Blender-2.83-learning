Lesson 1 
CGB Introduction, Installation
B4D Introduction
BBE Preface 

Be sure to have a version of Blender 2.83, installed at your Linux or Windows computer before going on.
MX-21 has blender 2.83.x at its repositories, https://mxlinux.org/download-links/
Fedora 35 has blender 2.9x , so I do not recommend it for this learning phase (https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/design-suite/ ) 
After you become familiar with blender 2.83, when you finish the lessons, then you can watch videos to pick up the differences of 2.93
Or go to https://www.blender.org/download/lts/2-83/ 

Lesson 2
BbE chapter 1, only the Overview of 3D workflow section
B4D chapter 1, only the Getting to know Blender section

On all subsequent lessons I assume that you will have the blender 2.8x open
and actively try things out.
